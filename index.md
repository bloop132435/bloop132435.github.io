## AI

My focus within the large field of AI is on the effecient quantization of neural networks. The two specific projects listed here are both mixed precision quantization schemes, meaning that the
different layers within the networks don't necessarily have the same quantization bit precision

---

### Hessian Quantization

The method builds off of HERO[^1] (**H**essian-**e**nhanced **R**obust **O**ptimization)
[] **TODO**: Write up stuff when approval received

### Iterative Quantization

## 8-bit CPU

This project involved building a mostly-functioning CPU from scratch, using only logic circuits offered in TI's 74-series of integrated circuits. Right now each of the components are working (ALU, RAM, Registers A/B, and the Decimal Display).
I am currently working on building the control logic, the part of the computer that will read and process instructions and command each part to do the appropriate operations. So far, I have finished the Ring Counter and the Program Counter portion of this final leg of the computer.
